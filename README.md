# QCon NYC 2015 Mini Talks
The following repository contains each of the mini talks for the 2015
QCon NYC Mini Talks. All code samples are referenced. Additionally, there
is a python script that merges each of the pdf's into a single slidedeck.
To execute, use python3, install PyPDF2, and execute build.py for each 
folder you want to merge the decks.

**Note: some of the projects are submodules. After cloning the repo down,
you will need to pull down the submodules. Try: 
git submodule update --init --recursive**
